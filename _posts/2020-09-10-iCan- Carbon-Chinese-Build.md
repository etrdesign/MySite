# The Frame

##### X-Gravel 52cm 1000g

# The Build
My frame is un-painted. Carbon color. The frame came in great shape really professional packaging. I had no issues when building the bike, cables were easily routed through the frame. I do wish there was tubing inside the mold to stop any rattleing while riding the bike. Although I can say I have been riding the bike for almost a year now and have rarely noticed any noise. I did zip tie the two cables that run into the frame at the entry point.
