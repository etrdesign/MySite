Hoping to figure out this coding. I donâ€™t know if i can. Very confusing what code works on GitHub and iAwriter. A lot of different info on the web nothing seems to work the way all the code is pasted. Hopefully this will make sense some time in the future for me.

I managed to get the basic image layouts for the posts, but if i write in certain areas of the post the text shows up in different areas.
