> Diverge E5 is still a killer bike for the price. You’re getting a really capable frame and fork, a 1:1 climbing gear (26.8 gear inches), Claris 8-speed STI shifters and the same wheelset as the US $2600 Diverge Carbon model! Expect the Diverge E5 to weigh around 11kg (24.3lbs) and you can get your hands on one for just US $1100.
